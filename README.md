This is an **addon** for the [John Smith Legacy](https://www.johnsmithlegacy.co.uk/)    
This addon makes it so that all ores glow in the dark.

Make sure that you are using [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home) and that you've set: `Options > Video Settings > Quality > Emissive textures` to `ON`.

Feel free to give suggestions or feedback.
